        <p class="font-italic">4.032: Design Studio: Information and Visualization</p>
        <p>For my third studio class, under the Architecture department at MIT, I'm developing my final project, based on a series of Yugoslavian post-WWII anti-fascist monuments. They are beautiful, abstract, painful monoliths telling the story under their earth. I am trying to show you these stories.</p>

        <h3>Motions of Volumetric Actuators</h3>
        <p class="font-italic">6.832: Underactuated Robotics</p>
        <p>For a <abbr title="Undergraduate Research Opportunity">UROP</abbr>, I was working on evaluating and designing new behaviors for a modular robot system made up of spherical volumetric actuators. Imagine a 2x4x1 system crawling like an inchworm, or a 2x2x2 system rolling. I'm interested in seeing how these robots could potentially be represented in the Drake workspace to evaluate behaviors or perhaps discover new ones.</p>

        <h3>JOAQ-board</h3>
        <p class="font-italic">2.S679: Electronics for Mechanical Systems II</p>
        <p>I made my own PCB! Since classes were completely virtualized, I brought wires, electronics, and.... an entire soldering station back to my parents' home. I'm going to be doing some simple orientation sensor and LED matrix sketches with it. I'm also diving into OpenCV and messing around with simple image tracking and recognition methods on a Raspberry Pi for this class. Cool stuff!</p>
